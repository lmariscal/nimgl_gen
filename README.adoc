== NimGL Generators

Repository that contains several tools to generate bindings for the diverse libraries NimGL binds to. The goal is to
fully automate the process of mantaining and updating this libraries, at the same time providing documentation inside
this bindings to give the developer the best experience at the moment of development.

Each generator will have it's readme with proper instructions on how to use it and generate proper bindings.

## This has been discontinued. All new generators will be done in their respective submodule under the NimGL's group.
