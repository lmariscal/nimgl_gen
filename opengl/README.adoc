== OpenGL Generator

This generator makes the opengl bindings with their respective wrapper and documentation grabbed from the https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenGL-Refpages[official ref-pages]. By default it uses the proc loader from the nimgl glfw bindings, so if you want to use the output directly withpout nimgl you will have to tweak it.

To use it:

* Clone this repo
* `cd` to this dir
* Either clone or download the zip the https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenGL-Refpages[official ref-pages]
* Rename the downloaded repo to `refpages`
* Run `nimble bake`
* A `gl.nim` has been generated
* Modify and Enjoy!

=== To Contribute
Feel free to improve the documentation, and how the loading is made follow the link:../CONTRIBUTING.adoc[Contributing] guide to know how to contribute.

If any extension is missing feel free to either open a Pull Request or open an Issue with all the details.
